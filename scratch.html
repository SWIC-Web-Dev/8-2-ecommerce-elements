      Use this to write out your HTML and get it formatted how you want before cutting and pasting into your template literals in the function components.
      
      Now trying to type and format HTML inside of template literals can be a bit of a pain. You may wish to just write out your HTML within the ['scratch file'](./scratch.html), and then cut and paste it into your component file, and continue editing there for the dynamic parts `${`.

      Alternatively, you can prompt Copilot, and let it do the best it can to generate the HTML for you. It's not perfect, but it can save you some time. Note that we are just generating **semantic HTML** here, so no need for any fancy classes or CSS. Just the bare minimum to get the job done.
