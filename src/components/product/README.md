# Product Card Example

This is a simple product card component. It shows the product's information in an `article` tag as a card.

Note that use of [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/tags-param) in [the function component.](./card.js) You may wish to follow this too, but it's not required. **Hint:** Copilot is decent at generating JSDocs for you. Just highlight your function, do 'ctrl/cmd + i', and say `/docs` to get a JSDoc template.
